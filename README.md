Hello,

My name is Ferhat. I am a student at Sakarya University, pursuing computer science education. While I don't have any professional work experience yet, I'm dedicated to continuous learning and improvement.

I have a keen interest in game development and design. Currently, I'm focused on game development and spend my free time coding games. You can explore my projects on my GitHub profile to see how I reflect these passions.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I'd like to highlight my language skills. I'm proficient in English at the C1 level and Turkish is my native language.

By reviewing the projects on my GitHub profile, you can get a closer look at how I utilize my coding skills and creativity. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about my projects.

Best regards,
Ferhat
